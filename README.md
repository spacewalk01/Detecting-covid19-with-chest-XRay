# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray

In this repo, I attempted to predict COVID-19 disease from radiology X-RAY images. In the experiment, convolutional neural network ResNet18 was used and trained on real chest X-Ray images. The model was evaluated on the remaining 400 images, and achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% with 95% overall accuracy.
