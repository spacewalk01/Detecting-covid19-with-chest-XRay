# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray

In this repo, I attempted to predict COVID-19 disease from radiology images. In the experiment, ResNet18 was used and trained on the real chest X-Ray images of COVID-19 patients. The model was evaluated on 400 test images and achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% with 95% overall accuracy. The model classifies Chest X Rays in one of four classes: Normal, Viral, Pneumonio and COVID-19. Dataset from COVID-19 Radiography can be downloaded from Kaggle. A database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. This COVID-19 dataset contains 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection) and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images.
