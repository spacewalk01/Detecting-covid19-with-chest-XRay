# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray

In this repo, I attempted to predict COVID-19 disease from radiology images. In the experiment, ResNet18 was used and trained on the real chest X-Ray images with COVID infection. The model was evaluated on 400 test images and achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% with 95% overall accuracy.


## Results
